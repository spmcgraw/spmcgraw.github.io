# Fotomatic Project

The purpose of the project was to fix bugs on an existing webpage to make it responsive, and style it according to the [provided spec sheet](fotomatic_spec_landing_v3_.png).

Initial step was to review the HTML index.html file to ensure structure was complete.

Missing/Errornous items in HTML:

1. Missing lang in `<html>` element.
2. The `<head>` section was missing:
    1. Link to style.css file.
    2. The viewport meta tag for response design.
    3. The `<title>` element.
3. The `<body>` section was missing:
    1. Correct src links to images in the Features Section.
    2. The Quote Section comment was missing the proper closure.
